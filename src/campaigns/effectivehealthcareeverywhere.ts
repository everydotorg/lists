        "We're dedicated to the comprehensive control of malaria and other childhood infectious and neglected tropical diseases. Our work is focused on the control, management and, where appropriate, the eventual elimination of a range of diseases. We balance this focus with other factors that affect child and maternal health, particularly malnutrition. We are dedicated to ensuring our work is supported by strong evidence and remains grounded in the lessons we learn through implementation. We explore beyond current practice, to try out innovative ways – through research, implementation and policy development – to achieve effective and sustainable disease management and control.",

        'Strongminds provides life-changing mental health services to low-income Africans using an innovative community-based approach. In Africa, approximately 66 million women suffer from depression, it is the number one cause of disability. Due to the lack of investment in mental health services in Africa - women have no access to effective treatment. StrongMinds’ innovative approach adapts Group Interpersonal Therapy, a rigorously-tested therapeutic model that can be delivered by trained community members. To date, we have treated 80,000 women with depression, and 86% remain depression-free, six months after therapy ends. StrongMinds is the only organization scaling a proven, cost-effective solution to the depression epidemic in Africa.',
