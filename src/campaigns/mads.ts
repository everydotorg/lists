        "Ready for Rescue is committed to saving cats and dogs from the streets and shelters of New York City. We have a special commitment to the underdogs (and undercats) that end up in local kill shelters. We routinely save sick, injured, and senior animals, who in many cases are the last ones left on the shelter's euthanasia list. We provide our animals with the finest medical care, place them in foster homes and search for the best forever home for each cat and dog. Each year we rescue over 100 wonderful cats and dogs. Ready for Rescue is a 100% volunteer organization and every dollar goes to the care and well-being of our animals.",
